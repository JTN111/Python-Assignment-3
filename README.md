# Python-Assignment-3

**TASK1**
define(def) the function(suppose we named it 'fact'), give one argument let 'n';
We'll need an if-else condition to check if the input n is not smaller than 2;
If it is, then we return 1 as factorial of both '1' and '0' is 1, and in the 'else' part, we write the rest of the code. 
where we return n times fact (n-1) |i.e| return n * (fact(n-1)),
What it does is place a value(>=2) in the n, then the fact function is called again with input n-1.
This goes on until n=1, then 1 is returned directly and the loop ends.

For the rest outside the function, 
We take input for n from the user and use it in the function by calling it in the variable 'result'
and printing the variable as per the required output format.

**TASK2**

We begin by importing Python's Math module, asking the user for input, specifying its data type,
Then all there is to do is make a variable(here, 'result') and assign value of the sqrt(a), log(a), and sin(a)
one by one and printing their values in their forthcoming adjacent lines, so that we only have to use one variable and can 
print all three things(control statements can be used to print them by choice).
